        <h1>About Nothing But Value</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Nothing But Value</strong> was founded on a simple premise: <span class="highlight">SME IT services companies deserve the same quality AI transformation expertise as Fortune 500 enterprises—without the Fortune 500 price tag.</span></p>
        
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>After leading AI transformations at some of the world's largest companies, our founders recognized a massive gap in the market. While big consulting firms like McKinsey, Deloitte, and Accenture charge $500K-$2M+ for AI transformation projects, SMEs with 50-250 employees were left behind—unable to afford enterprise consulting but desperately needing AI expertise to stay competitive.</p>
        
        <p>We decided to change that. <span class="highlight">Nothing But Value brings Fortune 500-caliber AI executives directly to SME IT services companies at 1/5th the cost.</span></p>
        
        <h2>Our Approach: The 70-20-10 Framework</h2>
        <p>Unlike AI developers who focus purely on technology, we understand that successful AI transformation is about people first:</p>
        
        <p><strong>70% People & Change Management:</strong> Training, adoption, culture shift, and stakeholder alignment</p>
        
        <p><strong>20% Data & Architecture:</strong> Data readiness, governance frameworks, and infrastructure design</p>
        
        <p><strong>10% AI Models & Technology:</strong> Selecting and implementing the right AI solutions</p>
        
        <p>This is why 95% of AI projects fail—they focus on the 10% (technology) and ignore the 90% (people and data). We get it right.</p>
        
        <h2>Why We're Different</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">1. Fortune 500 Pedigree:</span> Our team has led AI at global enterprises with multi-million dollar budgets and teams of 50+ people.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">2. SME-Only Focus:</span> We exclusively serve SME IT services companies. We understand your constraints, speed, and decision-making.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">3. Hands-On Executives:</span> You work directly with experienced AI executives, not junior consultants.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">4. Fast ROI:</span> We prove value in 6-8 weeks with quick-win pilots, then scale to full transformation.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">5. Affordable Pricing:</span> $50K-$200K for comprehensive transformation vs. $500K-$2M from big firms.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>To democratize enterprise-grade AI transformation for the mid-market, helping SME IT services companies ride the AI supercycle and compete with larger players.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p><strong>Nothing But Value:</strong> Every dollar you invest must deliver measurable ROI. No fluff, no filler.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Clear pricing, honest timelines, and realistic expectations from day one.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Partnership:</strong> We succeed when you succeed. Your growth is our growth.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Excellence:</strong> Fortune 500 quality in everything we deliver.</p>
